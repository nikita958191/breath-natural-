üçÉ Breath Natural: UI/UX Case Study (Figma)

üåø Project Overview: Designing the Breath Natural E-commerce Experience
This repository contains the complete user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design assets for the plant e-commerce shop, Breath Natural.
The project focuses on designing a modern, intuitive shopping flow and an aesthetically pleasing product page for the current bestseller: the Monstera Deliciosa (Swiss Cheese Plant). The primary goal was to create a visual experience that conveys the brand's commitment to natural beauty and simplifies the process of buying and caring for houseplants.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
| design | Tool | Purpose |
| Figma | Primary tool for all wireframing, high-fidelity mockups, prototyping, and component library creation. |
| User Research | Defined user personas and key features (e.g., clear care instructions, visual size comparisons). |
| UI/UX Principles | Focused on modern, clean aesthetics with an emphasis on accessibility and mobile-first  |

‚ú® Key Design Features (Monstera Deliciosa Product Page)
Visual Hierarchy: The design prioritizes the plant's unique fenestrations (splits and holes) using high-quality imagery to capture the "Swiss Cheese Plant" appeal.

Simplified Care Guide: Integrated a concise, 3-line care breakdown (Light, Water, Humidity) directly on the product page to reduce purchase hesitation.

Brand Alignment: Utilized a natural color palette and typography that reflects the "Breath Natural" identity.

Responsive Design: Wireframes and mockups were created for desktop, tablet, and mobile views to ensure a seamless shopping experience on all devices.
